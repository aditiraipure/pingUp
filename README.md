# pingUP - Social Media Web Application (In Progress)

**Note:** This project is currently in progress and is being developed as part of my learning journey in full-stack MERN development. Some features are under active development.


A work-in-progress Social Media Web Application built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js).
This project demonstrates real-world full stack development concepts including authentication, background jobs, media optimization, and core social networking features.

## Project Status

Current Status: In Progress / Learning Project
Some features are implemented, while others are under active development and improvement.


## Project Overview

This application allows users to connect, communicate, and share content in real time.  
It is designed to provide hands-on experience with scalable application architecture, modern authentication systems, and asynchronous background processing.


## Tech Stack
